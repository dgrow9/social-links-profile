Front End Mentor Project 3 - Social Links Profile (Newbie)

This is a challenge.  The goal is tyo copy the provided screenshot of a webpage.  It has a card in the middle of the screen that includes the user's name, avatar, location, description, and social links.  The links have a hover state.  I will use the skills I've learned so far to try to recreate the image.  I will also follow the provided branding guidelines.

Some choices I made:
Used flexbox
Added hover states to the links
Combined two elements so that the text of the link would change color without me having to directly hover over the words
Added mobile version
Made the links open in a new tab with extra protection
Added a favicon icon
